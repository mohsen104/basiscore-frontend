# BasisCore

**Guid & Story**

**Document and guide for using BasisCore commands:**

First of all, I must say that this package is designed for programmers on both the client side and the server side of BasisCore.
These commands are written in order to reduce spelling and writing errors, increase the speed of coding and make the use of BasisCore more attractive.

**These commands consist of three important parts:**

- Tags
- Abbreviations
- Prerequisite commands
- Ready scripts

In this package, all the tags needed by BasisCore are defined along with their attributes, such as the tags: <basis> , <member> ...

In the following, some commands are designed as abbreviations, to know them, refer to the following table:

stt : <script type="texttemplate></script>

{#} : {##source##}

[#] : [##source#]


Most importantly, we have designed the prerequisite commands required by every BasisCore programmer:

CDN basiscore & alasql

script host for client

And finally, ready-made scripts including host settings and inline source commands are also designed for the client side:

host | settings | sources | $bc

## Npx
**To install the package, use the following command in vscode terminal:**
```npx
npx basiscore-front
```

## Developing

**This package is in the development stage and if its completion is important to you, I would be grateful if you inform me of the commands that may not be included in the package and are used in the BasisCore library, and the bugs that may have commands.**
